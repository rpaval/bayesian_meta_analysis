The R script and the files used to examine the level of intelectin-1 in healthy individuals and patients with cancer

This repository includes the script and the files that were used for two different analyses. 

Firstly, the R script ("itln1_comparison") was used to determine the differences in ITLN1 levels between healthy participants and cancer patients. 
The file also includes a sensitivity analysis, an analysis based on study quality, several subgroup analyses and a robustness check (as discussed in the manuscript).

Secondly, the R script ("itln1_estimation)" was used to determine ITLN1 concentrations in healthy individuals.
The file also includes an analysis based on study quality and several subgroup analyses based on gender and body mass index (BMI). 

The datasets required to run the R script and the data collection form were also added to this repository.
